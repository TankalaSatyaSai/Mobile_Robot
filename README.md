#Single Differential Drive Mobile Robot 
I've started this project after finding out there's a very famous tutorial on building this kind of mobile robot by [Articulated Robotics]([url](https://www.youtube.com/@ArticulatedRobotics)). I'm following his tutorials for the first stage of this project and then I'll implement a lot more of robotics and AI capabilities in future.
