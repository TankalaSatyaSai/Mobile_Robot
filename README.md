# Mobile Robot

I've started this project after finding out there's a very famous tutorial on building this kind of mobile robot by [Articulated Robotics]([url](https://www.youtube.com/@ArticulatedRobotics)). I'm following his tutorials for the first stage of this project and then I'll implement a lot more of robotics and AI capabilities in future. 

Till now i was able to create a URDF file of a basic mobile robot and simulated it in gazebo. Did teleop control but soon i'll be trying joystick control using joy package.
